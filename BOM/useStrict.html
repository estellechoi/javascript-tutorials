    // Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". (new in ECMAScript version 5)
    // With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
    // In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.
    // The this keyword refers to the object that called the function.
    // If the object is not specified, functions in strict mode will return undefined and functions in normal mode will return the global object (window)
    'use strict';
